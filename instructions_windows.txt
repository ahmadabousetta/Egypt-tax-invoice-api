1. Install latest python version from Windows Microsoft store. Your windows version must be at least Windows 8.
Make sure python is installed by running "py --version" in cmd. You should see 3.9 minimum.
If Microsoft store is not working, download from python.org

2. Create a folder for installing the script. (e.g. /ahmad/tax/api_python)

3. Create another folder where the script expects excel docs. (e.g. /ahmad/tax/upload)

4. If not already installed, install .NET Core 7.0 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks?cid=msbuild-developerpacks

5. Compile the c# signer code. Or use the already compiled files (Generally it's not recommended to use compiled files from unknown sources.)

6. Inside the script folder extract all project files.

7. Run install.bat one time only. Wait for "Press any key to continue..."

8. Run run-tax-api.bat whenever you want to run the script.You can place a shortcut anywhere.
